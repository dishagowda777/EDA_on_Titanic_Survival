# EDA on Titanic Survival Dataset

This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the Titanic dataset to uncover patterns and insights about passenger survival. The dataset contains demographic and socio-economic details such as age, gender, passenger class, and fare.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Objectives
- Clean and preprocess the Titanic dataset  
- Handle missing values and outliers  
- Perform descriptive statistics and feature analysis  
- Visualize key patterns using plots and graphs  
- Derive insights on which factors influenced passenger survival  

---

## ðŸ“Š Tools & Libraries
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook  

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Insights
- Female passengers had higher survival rates compared to males  
- First-class passengers had better survival chances than third-class  
- Younger passengers survived more often than older ones  
- High ticket fares correlated with higher survival probability
